      <p>
        The speed with which software releases need to happen these days calls
        for the need to automate and secure the whole software development
        lifecycle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery/deployment (CD) are
        DevOps processes that help to automate the software release process in a
        way that guarantees more seamless deployments. They also save time and
        money for an organization.
